  |   * But what exactly are the new Editor tools                           |
  |                                                                         |

  |     over your custom maps, campaigns and cutscenes                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Unit Modifiers - We're enabling players to modify the damage that   |
  |     any unit/structure receives as a percentage, including making       |
  |     them invulnerable. We're also looking into a teleport unit action   |
  |     for the editor                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Metalocations -We're adding support for 'metalocations' which       |
  |     indicate where things last happened on the map, for example the     |
  |     last attacker, last defender, last recruit, last unit used, last    |
  |     movement path, last death etc. There will also be new actions for   |
  |     locations, such as copying a location area, moving location by      |
  |     (x,y), and boolean operations between locations                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Gizmos - New place-able entities with an on and off state such as   |
  |     levers and chests. Using gizmos you can override terrain (e.g.      |
  |     draw bridges) and will also be able to enter new actions to set     |
  |     and toggle the gizmo state, as well as new conditions to check it   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Counters - We're adding new actions to perform arithmetic between   |
  |     counters as well as setting the counter to random value, and        |
  |     load/storing counter values to some other variables (HP, Groove     |
  |     etc.). There's also a new condition to compare counters             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Actions can now play sounds                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Map upload slots will also be increased so players can upload       |
  |     more maps at once                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Volcano biomes now available in the map builder for all your lava   |
  |     needs                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Balance Changes                                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Last but not least, this update also includes balance adjustments   |
  |     to a number of units and Commanders                                 |
  |                                                                         |
